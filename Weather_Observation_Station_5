Problem:
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths 
(i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first
when ordered alphabetically.

Query:
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) As CityLength FROM STATION ORDER BY CityLength ASC,CITY ASC LIMIT 1 ;
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) As CityLength FROM STATION ORDER BY CityLength DESC,CITY ASC LIMIT 1 ;
